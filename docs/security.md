# Security

## Row Level Security

Every user-owned table enforces `(select auth.uid()) = user_id` (or `= id`
for `profiles`) on all four operations. This was verified directly against
the live database — see `docs/database.md`'s "Verifying RLS and
constraints" section for the exact test performed (a second simulated user
could not see the first user's jobs, shifts, or breaks, and vice versa).

Never bypass RLS from application code. The only place that does is
`lib/supabase/admin.ts`, gated behind the `server-only` package, used only
for:

- Writing `audit_logs` rows (`lib/audit/log.ts`) — a user is never allowed
  to insert into their own audit log directly, since that would let a
  compromised or malicious client fabricate a false trail.
- Account deletion (`lib/actions/settings.ts#deleteAccountAction`) — needs
  `auth.admin.deleteUser`, which requires the service-role key.

Audit logging failures are caught and logged server-side; they never block
the primary action from succeeding (see `lib/audit/log.ts`).

## Secrets

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: safe to
  expose to the browser (that's what "publishable" means for Supabase).
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: server-only, never prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_`,
  never imported outside `lib/supabase/admin.ts`. `.gitignore` excludes all
  `.env*` files except `.env.example`, which contains no real values.

## Database function hardening

The Supabase security linter (`get_advisors`) flagged two issues after the
initial migrations, both fixed in `00000000000015_harden_functions.sql`:

- `set_updated_at()` had no pinned `search_path` — fixed with
  `set search_path = ''`.
- `handle_new_user()` (the new-user trigger, `security definer`) was
  callable directly by `anon`/`authenticated` via
  `/rest/v1/rpc/handle_new_user` — `EXECUTE` was revoked from `public`,
  `anon`, and `authenticated` so it can only ever run as the
  `auth.users` insert trigger.

Re-run `get_advisors` (security and performance) after any schema change.

## Redirect targets

Post-sign-in (`redirectTo`) and email-confirmation (`next`) redirect
targets come from URLs an attacker can craft, and were previously passed
straight to `redirect()` -- an open redirect. Both now go through
`lib/safe-redirect.ts#safeRedirectPath`, which only allows same-site,
root-relative paths (rejecting `//host`, `/\host`, absolute URLs, and
control characters). Covered by `tests/unit/safe-redirect.test.ts`.

## Locale and time zone input

Time zone and language are validated server-side with Zod on every write
(settings, the one-tap time zone prompt, signup), and again by database
constraints. Signup metadata is client-controlled (the anon key is
public), so `handle_new_user()` validates it itself and falls back to
`UTC`/`en` rather than trusting it -- this was tested with a malformed zone
against the live database.

## Attachments

The `attachments` Storage bucket is private (`public = false`). Files are
expected under `${auth.uid()}/...` and storage policies restrict access to
the owning user's folder. The app must never construct or expose a public
URL for a stored file — always issue a short-lived signed URL server-side
once the upload UI exists.

## Account deletion

Deleting the `auth.users` row cascades to every user-owned table via
`on delete cascade` foreign keys, removing profile, jobs, shifts, breaks,
journal entries, expenses, mileage, schedule entries, attachment metadata,
audit logs, settings, and AI conversation history in one operation. It does
not currently delete the underlying files in the Storage bucket — that's a
known gap (see `docs/current-state.md`) since there's no attachment upload
UI yet to have created any.

## What hasn't been verified

- No penetration-style testing of the Next.js server actions themselves
  (e.g. attempting to pass another user's ID through a form field) has
  been performed — RLS is the actual enforcement boundary, so this matters
  less, but every action also re-derives the user from
  `supabase.auth.getUser()` rather than trusting a client-supplied ID.
- The build sandbox used for this initial implementation could not reach
  the live Supabase project over the network, so the auth flow itself
  (signup email confirmation, login, session cookies) has not been
  exercised through a real browser session — only at the database layer.
  Do this before shipping to real users.
