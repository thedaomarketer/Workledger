# Current State

Last updated: 2026-09-25 (iOS-style UI refresh, public landing page, centered quick-create button).

This document describes what actually exists in the codebase today, as
opposed to what the product spec eventually calls for. See `docs/roadmap.md`
for what's next.

## What works end to end

- **Auth**: email/password registration, login, logout, password reset
  request + update, email confirmation callback (`app/auth/confirm`). Session
  refresh runs on every request via `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16's replacement for
  `middleware.ts`).
- **Database**: full schema applied to a live Supabase project (17
  migrations in `supabase/migrations/`) — `profiles`, `jobs`, `shifts`,
  `breaks`, `journal_entries`, `expenses`, `mileage_entries`,
  `schedule_entries`, `attachments`, `audit_logs`, `user_settings`,
  `ai_conversations`, `ai_messages`, plus a private `attachments` storage
  bucket. RLS is enabled and verified on every table (see `docs/security.md`).
  `jobs` also carries an optional `pay_frequency`/`pay_anchor_date`, and
  `user_settings` an optional `tax_country`/`tax_region`/`tax_city`, for the
  Pay & Taxes feature.
- **Calculation engine** (`lib/calculations/`): shift duration, paid/unpaid
  break handling, overtime split, per-workweek/day/month bucketing in a
  user's timezone, integer-cents money math. 36 unit tests cover the edge
  cases the spec calls out by name (midnight-crossing shifts, long shifts,
  multiple/paid/unpaid breaks, missing clock-outs, DST spring-forward and
  fall-back, overlap detection, rounding).
- **Jobs**: create, edit, archive/restore, delete (blocked if referenced
  data exists), per-job weekly/monthly stats.
- **Time tracking**: clock in/out, start/end break, manual shift entry
  (validated against overlaps and shift/break ordering), shift history with
  edit/delete, one-active-shift-per-user enforced at the database level.
- **Dashboard**: greeting, active-shift card or clock-in prompt, today/week
  metrics, overtime, estimated earnings, recent activity feed, upcoming
  shifts.
- **Journal**: structured entries (task, incident, safety issue, etc.) with
  icons, optional job/shift linkage — the Work Evidence Timeline's data
  source. Rendered as a timeline on `/journal`; surfaced on the dashboard.
- **Expenses / Mileage**: full CRUD, monthly totals, category breakdown for
  expenses.
- **Reports**: date-range + totals (hours, overtime, earnings, expenses +
  mileage), per-job breakdown, CSV export for hours and expenses.
- **Settings**: profile fields, preferences (workweek start day, default
  break length, overtime threshold, notifications), full JSON data export,
  account deletion (cascades through every table via `on delete cascade`).
- **Calendar**: month view merging worked/active shifts and schedule
  entries.
- **Audit log**: every mutation from a server action writes an
  `audit_logs` row via the service-role client.
- **AI Assistant** (`/assistant`): a real chat UI backed by the Anthropic
  API (`claude-opus-5`), with 9 read-only tools (`lib/ai/tools.ts`) scoped
  to the signed-in user's own data -- hours, overtime, earnings, shifts,
  expenses, mileage, schedule, journal entries, and a combined report.
  Conversation history persists to `ai_conversations`/`ai_messages`. See
  `docs/ai.md` for the full design. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to be set;
  without it, the assistant shows an error instead of crashing.
- **Pay & Taxes** (`/taxes`): upcoming-payday projection per job
  (`lib/calculations/payday.ts`, DST-safe), a pay-stub-style **pay period
  statement** (hours + gross pay from recorded shifts, plus estimated
  deductions/net pay for the current period once a jurisdiction is set),
  and an annual income tax + payroll deduction breakdown
  (`lib/calculations/tax/`) for a user-selected country/province-or-state/city,
  seeded from the user's own recorded earnings and editable. Single-filer,
  standard-deduction, 2024-bracket estimate, clearly labeled as such
  throughout the UI. Also surfaced as a compact "next payday" card on the
  dashboard. See `docs/tax.md`.
- **Installable / offline-resilient app (PWA)**: `app/manifest.ts` +
  `public/sw.js` make WorkLedger installable to a phone's home screen
  (`components/pwa/install-prompt.tsx` prompts on supporting browsers) and
  keeps the static app shell available when the network drops, falling back
  to a friendly `/offline` page instead of a browser error. Dynamic/auth
  pages always go to the network first -- nothing work-record-related is
  ever served stale.
- **Loading and error states**: `app/(app)/loading.tsx` shows a skeleton
  while any authenticated page's data loads; `app/(app)/error.tsx` and
  `app/global-error.tsx` catch runtime errors with a recovery screen instead
  of a blank page or default Next.js error overlay.
- **Visual analytics** (`/reports`): hand-rolled, dependency-free charts
  built in plain HTML/CSS (no charting library) --
  `components/charts/time-series-bar-chart.tsx`
  (weekly hours, regular vs. overtime stacked, and weekly earnings) and
  `components/charts/category-bar-chart.tsx` (hours/earnings by job,
  expenses by category) -- built on `lib/calculations/timeseries.ts#summarizeByWeek`
  (DST-safe weekly bucketing, reusing the same duration/overtime math as
  every other report) and `lib/charts/scale.ts` (nice-numbers axis
  scaling). Colors follow the dataviz skill's validated, CVD-checked
  categorical palette (`--chart-1..8` in `app/globals.css`); job/category
  bars carry a direct value label and hover/focus tooltip, never gating a
  number behind hover alone. The existing "By job" table remains the exact
  numeric reference alongside the charts.
- **Landing page** (`/`): signed-out visitors get a marketing homepage
  (hero, feature overview, privacy section, sign-up/sign-in calls to
  action); signed-in users are redirected straight to `/dashboard`. Every
  feature it describes is one that actually exists -- no invented stats or
  testimonials. The phone mockup in the hero is a static illustration.
- **iOS-style design system**: grouped-gray background with white inset
  cards, Apple's accessible system blue/red/green (each >= 4.5:1 on white),
  SF Pro on Apple devices (Geist elsewhere), capsule buttons with press
  feedback, frosted-glass header/sidebar/tab bar (`glass` utility in
  `app/globals.css`), iOS switches and segmented tabs, and dialogs that
  present as swipe-style bottom sheets with a grabber on phones. Inputs use
  16px text on mobile so iOS Safari doesn't auto-zoom on focus;
  `viewport-fit=cover` + `env(safe-area-inset-*)` padding keep bars clear of
  the notch and home indicator.
- **Quick-create menu**: a floating "+" button in the center of the mobile
  tab bar (an equal-width five-column grid, so it sits exactly at the
  screen's center; Calendar moved to the More screen to keep two tabs per
  side) and a "Create" button at
  the top of the desktop sidebar (`components/app-shell/create-menu.tsx`)
  open a sheet of shortcuts -- log a shift, add an expense, add mileage, new
  journal entry, add a job -- that deep-link to the page owning that create
  dialog via a `?new=` param (`hooks/use-auto-open.ts`), so the dialog opens
  automatically without duplicating any form/validation logic.
- **Language & time zone**: the whole app (every page, dialog, toast,
  validation and server error, CSV header, and the AI assistant's replies)
  is available in **English, French, and Spanish**, with dates, numbers,
  and currency formatted for the language (`en-US` / `fr-CA` / `es-US`).
  **Settings → Language & region** holds the language, currency, and a
  searchable picker over every IANA time zone (with UTC offsets, the
  current time there, and a "use this device's time zone" button). Signup
  captures the device's zone and the current language; accounts still on
  the UTC default get a one-tap banner to switch to the device's zone.
  Signed-out pages (landing, sign-in, sign-up) have a language switcher; the
  language otherwise comes from the saved profile, then the browser's
  `Accept-Language`. Every wall-clock value a user types (manual shifts,
  journal times, report/calendar ranges, CSV filters, AI date ranges) is
  read in the user's saved zone on the server -- see "Time zones" in
  `docs/architecture.md`.

Verified directly against the live Supabase project (`WorkLedger`,
`hdeshlblsdsplpyayanz`) via SQL: the new-user trigger creates a profile and
default settings row, the one-active-shift constraint rejects a duplicate
clock-in, and RLS correctly hides one user's jobs/shifts/breaks from another
user while still exposing their own. `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`,
`npm test` (141/141), and `npm run build` all pass. The charts and quick-create
menu were also verified visually (desktop + mobile viewports, hover/focus
tooltips) -- and the French/Spanish UI, time zone picker, and time zone
prompt at phone width -- via a temporary unauthenticated preview route +
Playwright screenshots, since this sandbox can't reach the live Supabase project to
exercise the authenticated app directly.

## What's stubbed or missing

- **Attachments/receipts**: the `attachments` table and private storage
  bucket + RLS policies exist, but there's no upload UI yet. Expenses have
  a `receipt_url` column that's currently unused.
- **Job detail tabs**: the spec describes Overview/Time/Journal/Expenses/Reports/Settings
  tabs per job. The current `/jobs/[id]` page is a single overview (stats +
  this month's shifts + edit), not tabbed.
- **PDF export**: only CSV export is implemented for reports.
- **Notifications**: `user_settings.notifications_enabled` exists as a
  preference, but no actual push/email notifications are sent (payday and
  shift reminders are shown in-app only -- see Pay & Taxes below).
- **E2E browser test**: Playwright is installed but no `tests/e2e/` suite
  exists yet, and the sandboxed build environment used for this initial
  build could not reach the live Supabase project's domain over the
  network (outbound egress is allowlisted per-environment), so the running
  app itself was never exercised in a real browser here. The full flow was
  instead verified at the database layer directly (see `docs/security.md`).
  Run `npm run dev` with `.env.local` filled in from a network that can
  reach `*.supabase.co` to do a real browser pass.
- **Monetization, teams/business features**: not started (Phase 8/9 in the
  original spec). Coming next: billing/subscriptions (Stripe), reusing the
  existing connected Stripe account.
- **AI Assistant**: non-streaming (shows a "Thinking..." indicator, not
  token-by-token output), no conversation switcher (only the most recent
  conversation is resumed), and no rate limiting on the chat endpoint yet.
- **Translations**: French and Spanish were written in-house, not by a
  professional translator; province/state/city names in tax lines stay in
  English. Supabase's own auth error messages (e.g. on signup) and emails
  are still English. The unused `profiles.date_format` column is no longer
  exposed -- dates follow the language's conventions instead.
- **Pay & Taxes**: tax bracket data (`lib/calculations/tax/`) is a
  hand-written, point-in-time snapshot for the 2024 tax year, not pulled
  from a live feed -- see the caveats in `docs/tax.md`. No push/email
  payday reminders yet -- payday surfaces on the dashboard and `/taxes`
  when the app is open, but isn't pushed to the user in the background.

## Live deployment

- Production: **https://workledger-three.vercel.app**, deployed from the
  `Personal-Main` branch via the `workledger` Vercel project (auto-linked
  to the same Supabase project through Vercel's Supabase integration,
  which also provisioned the real `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` there --
  account deletion and audit logging work in production even though
  `.env.local` only has a placeholder for that key locally).
- Vercel's SSO/team-only deployment protection was disabled so the app is
  publicly reachable; `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is set to the production URL
  for correct password-reset/email-confirmation links.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is **not** yet set on Vercel -- add it in the
  project's environment variables for the AI Assistant to work in
  production (see `docs/ai.md`).

## Live Supabase project

- Project: `WorkLedger` (ref `hdeshlblsdsplpyayanz`, `us-east-1`), created
  under the same organization as the user's other projects, on the free
  tier.
- To free up a project slot, `gloworganicatelier@gmail.com's Project` was
  paused (with explicit user confirmation) — it can be resumed from the
  Supabase dashboard at any time.
- `.env.local` (gitignored) has the real project URL and anon key wired up.
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is a placeholder — fill in the real value from
  the Supabase dashboard's API settings before using account deletion or
  relying on audit logging locally.
